          With Facebook’s recently unveiled Libra cryptocurrency high in the
          news agenda across the world in recent weeks, China has emerged as a
          perhaps surprising leader when it comes to public interest in the
          project. While cryptocurrency use is banned in the country, as is
          Facebook itself, searches for “Libra” on the nation’s web search giant
          Weibo are soaring at press time. While the top two hottest search
          trends address a Chinese film celebrity’s jealous children and the
          first movement of Leonardo da Vinci’s iconic Mona Lisa painting

          third place, and were in second place previously.
